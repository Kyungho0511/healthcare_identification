[Feedback from the final presentation]

1. besides the clustering method, what story can you tell in the end?
   for example, how is shortage areas in Queens different from Bronx or Brooklyn?
   How the shortage areas for commercial enrollees are different from Medicaid enrollee?
   Make a share section that integrates a set of analyses to tell a story.
