Functionalities to implement further:

1. d3.js chart for showing clustering results

2. Move dropdown menu in cluster legend to the sidebar area

3. chatGPT API to label cluster numbers dynamically

4. Store cluster result to session storage and re-render it on page reload.

5. If cluster button is clicked before page is fully loaded, the cluster legend dropdown menu is not updated.
