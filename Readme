[Feedback from the final presentation]

1. besides the clustering method, what story can you tell in the end?
   for example, how is shortage areas in Queens different from Bronx or Brooklyn?
   How the shortage areas for commercial enrollees are different from Medicaid enrollee?
   Make a share section that integrates a set of analyses to tell a story.

2. Tell more story on the neighborhood like ethnicity, demogrphic profile. the targeted
   areas in Bronx, for exmaple, have Latino populations whereas the Brooklyn area has
   orthodox Jewish and Chinese populations. Consider incorporating neighborhood boundaries or names
   along with demograhpic profiles of those neighborhoods.

3. Click the final region shows popup with clustering traits
